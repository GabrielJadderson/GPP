\section{Conclusion}

We present a Datagram Network Layer which can forward datagrams across hosts and routers in an artificial network,
which we show to be capable of behaving according to the principles of a Reliable Data Transfer protocol.
Along with the capability of both-way half-duplex and full-duplex communication.
