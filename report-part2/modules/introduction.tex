\section{Introduction}

The goal of this project is to expand the capabilities of the solution for the previous part with a "real" network layer. For hosts this means a layer implementation that can send and receive datagrams with messages from/to the transport layer. For the routers, this means a layer implementation that can receive datagrams and forward them in the direction of the destination host.\\
Figure \ref{fig:GivenTopology} from the project description illustrates the topology for which it is a requirement that the solution functions. Note that the routers are called 1 and 2 rather than C and D, both in the source code and this report, to ease distinction between routers and hosts.
