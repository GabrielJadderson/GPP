\section{Introduction}
We are required to extend the capabilities of an implemented RDT(Reliable Data Transfer) model to multiple neighbours.

The given model can only communicate with two consecutive neighbours, an illustration of this is given in \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:single_host_illustration}}

\end{figure}


Thus the goal of this project is to communicate across multiple hosts. \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:multi_host_illustration}}

The `neighbour' referenced denotes an entity that can receive and send packets.
