\section{Conclusion}
We present a fully functional layer stack for a simulated network, providing all the necessary services to provide reliable end-to-end communication between applications on end hosts.\\
We can extend this program to any application and use the underlying API to send packets across the simulated internet.\\
To further enforce the integrity of the solution, further and more complex testing would have to be performed, and some technical debt was generated during the development of the transport layer, which would likely form the basis for further work.
