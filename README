DESCRIPTION: This file contains information on compilation and setting up
the subnet library  libsubnet.a.

Requierements
-----

A working pthreads installation and gnu-make

Installing:
-------------

The files are packaged in subnet.tgz.

The installation process of libsubnet.a  creates sub-dirs lib/ and include/

The installation folder can be selected by setting the parameter INSTALLDIR in the
Makefile. Initially, we use the same dir as the source code.

In the same way, fontsize in the graphical windows kan be set by the FONT parameter in
the Makefile. The size of the graphical windows can be set using the GEOM parametr, also in the Makefile

Now, the subnet library can be installed by:

	make
	make install
	make clean

The test programs can be compiled with the commands:

	make
	make tests

Uninstallation by:

	make uninstall

If the install folder also should be deleted:

	make full-uninstall


Running the test programs:
-------------------------

The Test programs (nettest, signaltest og timertest) must be run via 'network':

network [option]

Where the options are:

   -h           Help/prints the options.
   -v           Prints  version number.
   -p<name>     'name' as test program-name.
   -n<number>   Number of stations (2-8).
   -e<number>   Error frequency (0-1000).
   -a <arg1 ..> Delivers argument list to the test programs
   -x           Starts simulation without using the xterm-windows for the netstations.
